            Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad field of computer science that aims to create 
            systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These 
            tasks include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

            Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms 
            and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific 
            task through experience, without being explicitly programmed for every scenario.

            Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple 
            layers (deep neural networks) to model and understand complex patterns in data. It has 
            been particularly successful in areas such as image recognition, natural language 
            processing, and speech recognition.

            Applications of AI include:
            - Autonomous vehicles
            - Medical diagnosis
            - Recommendation systems
            - Natural language processing
            - Computer vision
            - Robotics

            The field continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs in areas such as 
            generative AI, reinforcement learning, and quantum machine learning.
